What we learned in Day 2
This is your first chance to see some of Ruy's sugar and also a little of
the magic. You're starting to see how flexible Ruby can be. The collec-
tions are dead simple: two collections with multiple APIs layered on top.
Application performance is secondary. Ruby is about the performance
of the programmer. The enumerable module gives you a flavor of just
how well-designed Ruby can be. The single-inheritance is packed with
intuitive design and useful features. This level of abstraction gives you
a marginally better programming language. But serious mojo is on the way.
